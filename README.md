# cpp_truth_table

# Description

This simple c++ console program prints out a truth table based on the input boolean expression.

# Instructions

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your forked repository.
3. Run the app.exe file.

# Usage

You can customize some feature in the customization.cpp file.

Making the project was so challenging that I decided to abandon it. What it only does is printing out the initial truth table of the input variables, it is unable to handle any logic.

If you still want to run the program here is an example in the terminal:
''
$ ./app.exe
Enter str or enter '?' to escape: a & b | -c
=====================================
| a | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
=====================================
| b | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
=====================================
| c | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
=====================================
Enter str or enter '?' to escape: ?
$
''

Even it fails, I have learnt that you should plan your project carefully and seperate your source code into different files.
